							In a world where a million videos are published every day, Wirewax is a platform that lets anyone make their videos stand out from the crowd.  The main challenges were explaining to users how they could use a feature rich product &amp; designing for both free &amp; premium users needs. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Premium users wanted to create completely bespoke interactive video advertising &amp; I am priveleged to have designed something so many respected brands trusted.

		 		<p>
		 			The technology of Wirewax is incredibly complex &amp; feature rich.  People use products because they let them do what they came to do, simply.  The more features, the more powerful a product is but without the correct goals in place this can lead to a bloated product that no one can use, simply.  So I questioned each requested feature &amp; how to make it most useful to users.
		 		</p>
		 		<p>
		 			In lots of these start ups everyone has great ideas but its important, for the end user, these ideas can fit together to make a unified coherent experience.  The best products let users think naturally and conform to us, not the other way around.  <span class="block pFocus">Show why the product is useful, not how.</span>  
		 		</p> 	
		 		<p>
		 			A lot of tech start ups think talking deeply about the tech helps sell the product but that can backfire.  I try to hide the technology behind a simple human interface. That lets people focus on why they logged in in the first place.

	    		<h2>Spatial interfaces</h2>
		 	</div>
	

		 	<div class="unit two-thirds">
		 		
		 		<p>
		 			People think in 3D spaces. Books are in bookcases, bath towels are in the bathroom, &amp; the bathroom is up the stairs.  Things are always within bigger things/spaces. For responsive interfaces breadcrumbs don't cut it.   I try to treat products I design like architecture - as if I'm making a home people will be living in for a lifetime.
		 		</p>
		 		<p>
		 			It involves planning as thereâ€™s many things to consider: building a foundation to support an entire project and its design, thinking about users, how they will interact with it, what they need at each step &amp; designing everything in modules to allow flexibility for the future.  This helps me organise the user interface spatially.

		      		With a team ratio of 15 developers to 1 product designer (me) it was important to be as helpful &amp; quick as possible.  The project scope, the CEO's vision &amp; our limited resources, meant using agile &amp; waterfall methodologies.  An MVP was defined &amp; once each feature was designed &amp; approved, the development team would begin implementation.  
		      	</p>
		      	<p>
		      		I followed up by designing the next features in the pipeline, whilst also working with the development teams to execute the currently developed features through to completion. <span class="block pFocus">Team ratio of 15 developers to 1 designer (me)</span> 
		      	</p>
		      	<p>
		      		Throughout this I worked closely with senior stakeholders to drive decision-making &amp; then ensure consistency across brand &amp; product features. At each company retreat I presented all staff with the vision for the next product cycle to help build consensus. Yes, at the time Bearded Yellow Power Ranger was a cool look.
